			<h3>Excerpts</h3>
			<p><!--Chapter 1-->
				"Throughout recorded time, and probably since the end
				of the Neolithic Age, there have been three kinds of people
				in the world, the High, the Middle, and the Low. They have
				been subdivided in many ways, they have borne countless
				different names, and their relative numbers, as well as
				their attitude towards one another, have varied from age to
				age: but the essential structure of society has never altered.
				Even after enormous upheavals and seemingly irrevocable
				changes, the same pattern has always reasserted itself, just
				as a gyroscope will always return to equilibrium, however
				far it is pushed one way or the other.
			</p>
			<p>
				The aims of these groups are entirely irreconcilable."
			</p>
			<p>
				 	- Chapter 1 <i>Ignorance is Strength</i>
			</p>
			<p><!--Chapter 3-->
				"The splitting up of the world into three great super-states
				was an event which could be and indeed was foreseen
				before the middle of the twentieth century...
				In one combination or another, these three super-states
				are permanently at war, and have been so for the past twenty-five
				years. War, however, is no longer the desperate,
				annihilating struggle that it was in the early decades of the
				twentieth century. It is a warfare of limited aims between
				combatants who are unable to destroy one another, have no
				material cause for fighting and are not divided by any genuine
				ideological difference."
