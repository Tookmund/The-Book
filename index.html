            			Emmanuel Goldstein was once the head of the Ministerial Regulation Committee, which granted him 
            			considerable power and leeway in his personal life. He became very interested in the origins of 
            			Ingsoc, and while researching it, he began contemplating the possible vices and future of the 
            			Party. Coming to the realization that Ingsoc was shockingly unstable. Writing <i>The Theory and 
            			Practice of Oligarchial Collectivism</i> as the culmination of his work, Goldstein was forced into 
            			exile by the Party. His present location is unknown, but it is believed that he leads the 
            			Brotherhood: a revolutionary group dedicated to the overthrow of the government of Oceania and 
            			the destruction of Ingsoc.

			<h3>Excerpts</h3>
			<p><!--Chapter 1-->
				"Throughout recorded time, and probably since the end
				of the Neolithic Age, there have been three kinds of people
				in the world, the High, the Middle, and the Low. They have
				been subdivided in many ways, they have borne countless
				different names, and their relative numbers, as well as
				their attitude towards one another, have varied from age to
				age: but the essential structure of society has never altered.
				Even after enormous upheavals and seemingly irrevocable
				changes, the same pattern has always reasserted itself, just
				as a gyroscope will always return to equilibrium, however
				far it is pushed one way or the other.
			</p>
			<p>
				The aims of these groups are entirely irreconcilable."
			</p>
			<p>
				 	- Chapter 1 <i>Ignorance is Strength</i>
			</p>
			<p><!--Chapter 3-->
				"The splitting up of the world into three great super-states
				was an event which could be and indeed was foreseen
				before the middle of the twentieth century...
				In one combination or another, these three super-states
				are permanently at war, and have been so for the past twenty-five
				years. War, however, is no longer the desperate,
				annihilating struggle that it was in the early decades of the
				twentieth century. It is a warfare of limited aims between
				combatants who are unable to destroy one another, have no
				material cause for fighting and are not divided by any genuine
				ideological difference."
			</p>
			<p>
				- Chapter III <i>War is Peace</i>
			</p>
			<p><!--Created excerpt-->
				"The Ministry of Truth is inevitable: if the people had access 
				to true records of the past, they would be given something which to compare 
				and therefore something for which to strive. If there exists no record of the past, 
				some select individuals will invariably complain and might, perhaps, pose a threat 
				to the government. However, with a false history, tailor-made to glorify the Party 
				and Big Brother, potential dissidents assured of the Party's total competence."
